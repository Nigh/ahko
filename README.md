## Usage

ahko scans two levels of directories in the watch folder. The number of objects per directory level is limited to 16. This means that a maximum of 16x16 = 256 objects can be listed.
This is because too many objects would NOT make the launcher "quick" enough.

### icon

Icons can be obtained automatically. And you can set it by your own.
Folder icons can be set by placing a png image with the name `_icon.png` in the folder.
Item's icon can be set by placing a png image with the same name as the item. For example, put `abc.lnk` and `abc.png` in the same folder, the icon of `abc.lnk` would be set to `abc.png`.
